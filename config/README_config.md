# Configuration quick reference

Each block under `steps:` now follows the sequential naming pattern `stepNN_action`.
Adjust values under these keys instead of editing the scripts.

## Required paths

- `paths.raw_genotypes` – CSV exported from the genotyping platform (SNPs × samples).
- `paths.probe_annotation_excel` – Excel workbook with SNP identifiers and genome positions.
- `paths.probe_annotation_map` – Tab-delimited version of the probe metadata used by PLINK.
- `paths.mlm_stats` – TASSEL exports the mixed-model results here after you run GWAS.
- `paths.ld_summary` – Generated by PLINK after the LD command; used for the decay plot.
- `paths.prune_in` – Generated by PLINK during LD pruning; used to build pruned matrices.

## Per-step blocks

Every block under `steps:` can be removed to skip that action.
Defaults match the folder structure documented in the project README.

When adding new steps, extend `workflow/gwas_pipeline/steps.py` and register the
name in the `STEP_SEQUENCE`/`STEP_FUNCTIONS` mappings.
